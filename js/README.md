# ‚è≥ js-tiktoken

tiktoken is a [BPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) tokeniser for use with
OpenAI's models. This is a pure JS port of the original tiktoken library.

Install the library from NPM:

```
npm install @dingyi222666/js-tiktoken
```

**This fork remove the default encoding files, you need to load the encoding files by yourself.**
